# My New Web Developer Portfolio

### I am creating a new site to show how my skills and knowledge have improved.

**My old portfolio doesnt reflect how my skills and knowledge have improved.**

**Since then I have learnt so much more and I want my new portfolio to reflect that
it is still a work in progress and adding more to it everyday!**
